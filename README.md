# Introduction

After playing video games all my life and being inspired by devlogs on YouTube, I decided to seriously try out game dev for the first time. One of my favorite games is Hollow Knight, so for my first project, my goal is to make a basic 2D action adventure utilizing PaperZD in Unreal Engine 5.

## Overall To-do List

- [ ] Learn Aesprite so I can blend animations so only the above half sprite performs the animation attack override <br>
- [ ] Have camera movement similar to Hollow Knight <br>
- [ ] Make movement mechanics more similar to the Hollow Knight (e.g. dashes) <br>
- [ ] Add jump delay <br>
- [ ] Make a basic enemy programmed by simple AI <br>
- [ ] Able to fall through platforms after pressing down <br>
