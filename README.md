# Introduction

Hello! Lately, I've been watching many video game creation videos on YT, and am now inspired to create my own games.
We'll see how this goes. One of my favorite games is Hollow Knight, so I want to first aim to create 2D games using PaperZD on Unreal Engine first. Shoutout to Cobra Code on YT!

## Goals 10/2/2023

~ Create character animations using sprites from Itch.io. <br>
~ Be able to move the character, including dashing <br>
~ Have camera movement similar to Hollow Knight <br>
~ Make a basic map <br>
~ Make a basic enemy programmed by simple AI <br>
~ Learn how to use git better... <br>

## To-do List 10/7/2023

~ Add hitbox for attack animation <br>
~ Make only the above half sprite perform the animation attack override <br>
~ Make the map more expansive <br>
~ Maybe make the camera movement better
