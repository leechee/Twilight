# Introduction

Hello! Lately, I've been watching many video game creation videos on YT, and am now inspired to create my own games.
We'll see how this goes. One of my favorite games is Hollow Knight, so I want to first aim to create 2D games using PaperZD on Unreal Engine first. Shoutout to Cobra Code on YT!
